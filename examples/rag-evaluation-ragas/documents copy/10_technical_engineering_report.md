## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### 1.0 PROJECT BACKGROUND

Okafor Engineering Solutions (OES) was retained by the City of Millbrook to conduct a comprehensive structural assessment of Bridge 7, a critical infrastructure asset connecting Historic Downtown with Riverside District across the Millbrook River. The bridge, constructed in 1963, has served the community for 61 years without major rehabilitation.

The assessment was initiated following routine inspection observations indicating potential structural concerns. Our investigation was conducted October 5-10, 2024, utilizing advanced non-destructive testing methods, structural analysis software, and field inspection protocols.

### 2.0 STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION

**Bridge Type:** Steel truss bridge with concrete deck  
**Span Configuration:** Single span, 342 feet (104.2 meters)  
**Width:** 38 feet (11.6 meters)  
**Design Load:** AASHTO HS20-44 (40-ton vehicle)  
**Average Daily Traffic (ADT):** 12,400 vehicles  
**Original Construction:** 1963  
**Design Life:** 75 years (expected service until 2038)  
**Current Age:** 61 years (81% of design life elapsed)

### 3.0 INSPECTION METHODOLOGY

OES employed multiple assessment techniques:

**3.1 Visual Inspection**
- Complete bridge walk-through by certified inspection team  
- High-resolution photography documenting all structural elements  
- Identification of visible distress indicators  

**3.2 Non-Destructive Testing**
- Ultrasonic testing of steel members  
- Ground-penetrating radar for concrete deck assessment  
- Magnetic particle inspection for surface crack detection  
- Acoustic emission monitoring for active crack propagation  

**3.3 Material Testing**
- Core samples extracted from concrete deck (12 locations)  
- Steel samples analyzed for material properties and fatigue  
- Laboratory analysis of corrosion products  

**3.4 Structural Analysis**
- Finite element modeling of existing conditions  
- Load rating calculations per AASHTO guidelines  
- Dynamic response analysis  
- Fatigue life assessment  

**3.5 Geotechnical Investigation**
- Subsurface exploration of foundation conditions  
- Scour assessment of river bottom  
- Soil stability analysis  

### 4.0 KEY FINDINGS

#### 4.1 CRITICAL DEFICIENCIES

**4.1.1 Primary Support System Degradation**

The main truss members exhibit significant deterioration beyond acceptable serviceability limits:

- **Pylon Displacement:** Eastern pylon has displaced 15.3 cm (6.0 inches) from design position, indicating foundation movement and/or structural deformation  
- **Load Capacity Reduction:** Current estimated capacity is 26 tons, representing 65% of original 40-ton design specification  
- **Beam Cracking:** Eight of twelve primary support beams show micro-cracking patterns consistent with fatigue loading  
- **Connection Deterioration:** 23 critical connections show signs of corrosion and loosening  

**Technical Analysis:**

Finite element modeling indicates stress concentrations exceeding design assumptions by 47% at primary connection points. This stress redistribution results from cumulative effects of:
- Material degradation (corrosion-induced section loss: 8-12%)  
- Foundation settlement (differential settlement: 3.8 cm)  
- Increased loading (modern vehicles exceed 1963 design assumptions)  
- Environmental factors (freeze-thaw cycles, de-icing salt exposure)  

**4.1.2 Foundation Integrity Concerns**

Geotechnical investigation revealed concerning foundation conditions:

- **Differential Settlement:** Eastern foundation has settled 3.8 cm more than western foundation  
- **Scour Damage:** River bottom scour has undermined eastern pier by approximately 1.2 meters  
- **Soil Erosion:** Supporting soil matrix shows erosion and void formation  
- **Water Infiltration:** Groundwater has penetrated concrete foundation, causing internal deterioration  

**Risk Assessment:**

Foundation conditions contribute to overall structural instability. Continued scour progression could accelerate failure timeline. Immediate implementation of 15-ton load restriction is recommended pending rehabilitation.

**4.1.3 Dynamic Response Anomalies**

Modal analysis and vibration testing revealed abnormal dynamic characteristics:

- **Natural Frequency Shift:** Primary natural frequency has decreased 18% from original design  
- **Damping Reduction:** Structural damping reduced 23%, indicating loosened connections  
- **Resonance Risk:** Current frequency approaches typical traffic excitation frequencies  
- **Fatigue Indicators:** Stress-cycle counting suggests remaining fatigue life of 12-18 months under current loading  

**Technical Implications:**

The shift in dynamic properties indicates loss of structural integrity and progression toward failure modes. The bridge is entering a critical phase where small additional degradation can precipitate rapid failure.

#### 4.2 MODERATE DEFICIENCIES

**4.2.1 Concrete Deck Deterioration**

- Surface cracking affecting 34% of deck area  
- Spalling and delamination: 850 square feet total  
- Chloride infiltration: 15 of 12 core samples exceed threshold  
- Reinforcement corrosion: Active in 40% of deck area  

**4.2.2 Steel Corrosion**

- Section loss averaging 8-12% in critical members  
- Active corrosion sites: 47 locations documented  
- Protective coating failure: 67% of painted surfaces  

**4.2.3 Expansion Joint Failure**

- Both expansion joints severely deteriorated  
- Debris accumulation preventing proper function  
- Water infiltration contributing to deck deterioration  

### 5.0 LOAD RATING ANALYSIS

Current load rating calculations per AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation:

**Inventory Rating (normal conditions):**
- Legal Load (HS20): RF = 0.65 (equivalent to 26 tons)  
- Posting Load Recommendation: 15 tons maximum  

**Operating Rating (occasional overload):**
- Legal Load (HS20): RF = 0.82 (equivalent to 33 tons)  
- Occasional permits: Not recommended  

**Comparison to Original Design:**
- Original Design Load: 40 tons  
- Current Safe Load: 26 tons  
- **Capacity Loss: 35%**

### 6.0 FAILURE PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

Using reliability-based assessment methods and probabilistic structural analysis:

**Current Condition (October 2024):**
- Probability of serviceability failure: 12%  
- Probability of ultimate failure: 2.3%  

**Projected Condition (No Intervention):**

| Time Frame | Serviceability Failure | Ultimate Failure |
|------------|----------------------|------------------|
| 6 months | 28% | 5.7% |
| 8 months | 42% | 11.2% |
| 10 months | 61% | 22.8% |
| 12 months | 78% | 41.3% |
| 14 months | 89% | 63.7% |

**Critical Timeline:** 8-14 months represents transition from acceptable to unacceptable risk levels. Immediate action is strongly recommended.
