MILLBROOK - In a unanimous vote Tuesday night, the Millbrook City Council approved a $2.5 million rehabilitation project for Bridge 7, the 61-year-old span connecting Historic Downtown with Riverside District across the Millbrook River.

The bridge, constructed in 1963, will be completely closed to all traffic for an estimated 6-8 months beginning November 1, 2024, following an engineering assessment that identified critical structural deficiencies.

### Engineering Assessment Reveals Critical Problems

Sofia Okafor, PE, principal engineer at Okafor Engineering Solutions, presented findings from a comprehensive structural assessment conducted October 5-10. The report identified multiple failure points requiring immediate intervention.

"The bridge has reached a critical point in its structural lifespan," Okafor told the Council. "Our analysis shows current load capacity at only 65% of the original 40-ton design specification. Without intervention, we're looking at a failure timeline of 8-14 months."

Key structural deficiencies include:
- Pylon displacement of 15.3 centimeters from design specifications  
- Micro-cracking in eight of twelve primary support beams  
- 18% reduction in natural frequency, indicating structural fatigue  
- Foundation integrity concerns due to differential settlement and erosion

The bridge has been restricted to 15-ton maximum vehicle weight since October 1, when preliminary inspection results became available. The bridge's original design specification called for a 40-ton capacity, now reduced to an estimated safe working load of 25 tons.

### Economic Impact on Downtown Businesses

The closure is expected to significantly impact Historic Downtown businesses, with city economists projecting revenue losses of approximately $47,000 per day across the district.

Ahmed Al-Rashid, president of the Historic Downtown Business Association and owner of Al-Rashid Imports, expressed concern about the extended closure period.

"Six to eight months is a long time for small businesses," Al-Rashid told the Chronicle after the meeting. "Many of our customers come from Riverside District and University Heights. The detour will make it less convenient to visit downtown."

Rosa Romano, who has operated Romano's Bakery on Main Street since 1963 - coincidentally the same year Bridge 7 was constructed - echoed those concerns.

"Forty-one years I've served this community," Romano said. "I understand the bridge must be fixed for safety, but this will be difficult for businesses like mine that depend on foot traffic and regular customers."

### Small Business Relief Fund Approved

Recognizing the economic hardship, the Council approved a $500,000 Small Business Relief Fund to provide financial assistance to affected businesses.

The fund, administered by the Economic Development Department, will offer grants up to $15,000 to eligible businesses within a half-mile radius of Bridge 7 that can demonstrate a 20% or greater revenue decline during the construction period.

Applications will be accepted November 1-30, 2024, with priority given to businesses operating three or more years. Funds will be dispersed in two installments: 50% upfront and 50% upon project completion.

"This relief fund represents the city's commitment to our downtown business community," said Councilwoman Sarah Johnson (District 1). "We recognize that infrastructure improvements, while necessary, can create hardship for those who have faithfully served our community for decades."

### Hospital Coordinates Emergency Access

Dr. Elena Vasquez, Chief of Cardiology and Hospital Director at Millbrook General Hospital, raised concerns about increased emergency response times affecting patient outcomes, particularly for cardiac emergencies.

"Every minute matters in cardiac care," Dr. Vasquez told the Council. "The projected additional 4.7 minutes in response time could impact survival rates for heart attack patients."

In response to these concerns, Okafor Engineering has developed special protocols allowing emergency vehicle access during specific hours of construction. The plan includes single-lane alternating traffic for emergency vehicles during peak cardiac emergency hours (6:00-9:00 AM and 5:00-8:00 PM).

Rebecca Martinez, Emergency Nurse Manager at Millbrook General, will serve as hospital liaison, coordinating weekly with construction management to monitor emergency response times.

"We're taking a proactive approach to ensure patient safety isn't compromised," Martinez said. "Sofia Okafor and her team have been very responsive to our concerns."

Fire Chief Robert Thompson confirmed that the Fire Department will position an ambulance in Historic Downtown during high-risk periods to minimize response time delays. The department is also enhancing medical helicopter protocols for time-critical cases.

### Traffic Management and Alternative Routing

Public Works Director James Mitchell outlined the traffic management plan, which designates Highway 45 to Oak Street Bridge as the primary detour route.

The alternative route adds approximately 3.2 miles and 4.7 minutes to average commute times under normal traffic conditions. During peak hours, delays could extend to 8-12 minutes.

The city will install temporary traffic signals at three intersections, implement an enhanced signage program, and provide real-time traffic updates via the city mobile app. School bus routing adjustments have been coordinated with Millbrook Unified School District.

"We understand this will be an inconvenience for everyone," Mitchell said. "But the alternative - a bridge collapse - is unthinkable. We're doing everything we can to minimize disruption."

### Community Coordination and Public Information

Councilman Marcus Chen (District 2), who chairs the Infrastructure and Public Works Committee, emphasized the importance of community cooperation during the construction period.

"This is a challenging situation that will require patience and flexibility from everyone," Chen said. "But I'm confident in our community's ability to come together and support one another through this period."

The city has allocated $75,000 for a comprehensive public information campaign, including:
- Multi-language outreach (English, Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic)  
- Social media updates and website with construction timeline  
- Direct mail to affected neighborhoods  
- Business community briefings  
- Monthly public meetings throughout construction period

The first community meeting is scheduled for November 5, 2024, at 6:30 PM at the Historic Downtown Community Center, with language interpretation and childcare services provided.

### Construction Timeline and Contractor Selection

Following the Council's approval, final engineering design will be completed by November 15, with bid advertisement from November 18 through December 9. Contractor selection is expected by December 16, with construction beginning January 2, 2025.

The rehabilitation project includes:
- Foundation reinforcement and stabilization  
- Primary beam replacement (eight beams)  
- Pylon realignment and anchoring  
- Deck resurfacing and waterproofing  
- Installation of structural monitoring system

Projected completion is July 15, 2025, with testing and inspection through July 31. If the project stays on schedule, Bridge 7 could reopen to traffic by August 1, 2025.

However, Okafor cautioned that unforeseen conditions discovered during construction could extend the timeline.

"Bridge rehabilitation projects often reveal additional issues once we begin excavation," Okafor said. "We've built in contingency time and budget, but residents should be prepared for the possibility of delays."

### Community Response

Public comment during the Council meeting reflected a mix of concerns and support for the project.

Several residents expressed frustration with the extended closure period and questioned whether complete bridge replacement might be more cost-effective in the long term.

"If we're spending $2.5 million on rehabilitation now, only to face the same situation in another 40 years, why not just build a new bridge?" asked University Heights resident David Park.

Public Works Director Mitchell explained that complete replacement would cost approximately $3.8 million and take 10-12 months, making rehabilitation the more economical choice for extending bridge life by 40-50 years at 60% of replacement cost.

Other residents expressed appreciation for the business relief fund and emergency access protocols.

"I'm glad the city is being proactive about helping our downtown businesses," said Riverside District resident Maria Gonzalez. "These establishments are part of what makes Millbrook special. We need to support them."

### Historical Context

Bridge 7 has been a vital connection point in Millbrook's infrastructure since its construction in 1963. The span is 342 feet long and 38 feet wide, carrying an average of 12,400 vehicles daily across the Millbrook River.

The bridge's construction was part of a broader infrastructure expansion program in the 1960s as Millbrook grew from a small town of 8,000 residents to a mid-sized city. Today, Millbrook's population exceeds 47,800 residents across four distinct neighborhoods.

This will be the first major rehabilitation work on Bridge 7 since its construction 61 years ago, though routine maintenance and minor repairs have been performed throughout its service life.

### Looking Ahead

City officials emphasized that while the bridge closure will create challenges, it's essential for public safety and the community's long-term infrastructure needs.

"Infrastructure isn't glamorous, but it's the foundation of everything we do," Mayor Patricia Thompson said in closing remarks. "Safe roads, reliable bridges, clean water - these are the basics we sometimes take for granted until they're threatened. This project is an investment in Millbrook's future."

The Council will receive weekly progress reports throughout the construction period, with quarterly economic impact assessments to determine if additional business relief funding is needed.
