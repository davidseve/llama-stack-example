### Item 3: Bridge 7 Infrastructure Emergency

**Presented by:** Councilman Marcus Chen

**Background:** Bridge 7, constructed in 1963, connects Historic Downtown with Riverside District across Millbrook River. Recent inspection by Sofia Okafor, PE, of Okafor Engineering Solutions revealed critical structural deficiencies requiring immediate action.

**Key Findings:**
- Current load capacity reduced to 65% of original 40-ton design specification
- Pylon displacement of 15.3 cm detected
- Micro-cracking in primary support beams
- Natural frequency reduced by 18%, indicating structural fatigue

**Safety Concerns:**
- Bridge currently restricted to 15-ton maximum vehicle weight
- Projected failure timeline: 8-14 months without intervention
- Average daily traffic: 12,400 vehicles

**Proposed Solution:**
- Complete bridge rehabilitation estimated at $2.3 million
- Construction timeline: 6-8 months
- Requires full bridge closure during construction
- Alternative route adds 4.7 minutes to average commute time

**Discussion:**

Councilwoman Rodriguez questioned whether complete replacement would be more cost-effective. Public Works Director Mitchell explained that rehabilitation extends bridge life by 40-50 years at 60% of replacement cost.

Councilman Kim raised concerns about emergency vehicle access. Fire Chief Thompson confirmed alternative routing adds minimal time for most responses, but hospital access would require coordination with Millbrook General.

Dr. Vasquez, speaking from the public gallery, noted that the 4.7-minute delay could impact cardiac emergency outcomes. She requested weekly coordination meetings with construction management.

**Economic Impact Analysis:**

City Manager Stevens presented economic impact study:
- Estimated business revenue loss: $47,000 per day during construction
- Tourism impact: 15-20% reduction during peak season
- Recommended small business relief fund: $500,000

Ahmed Al-Rashid requested priority consideration for Historic Downtown merchants in relief fund allocation.

**Vote:** Motion to approve Bridge 7 rehabilitation project and authorize expenditure up to $2.5 million (including contingency) passed 5-0.

**Conditions:**
- Weekly progress reports to Infrastructure Committee
- Bi-weekly public information meetings
- Coordination with Millbrook General Hospital for emergency routing
- Small business relief fund to be administered by Economic Development Department

### Item 4: Small Business Relief Fund Implementation

**Presented by:** Economic Development Director Sarah Williams

**Proposed Framework:**
- Application period: November 1-30, 2024
- Eligibility: Businesses within 0.5 mile radius of Bridge 7
- Maximum grant: $15,000 per business
- Demonstrates 20% or greater revenue decline during construction period
- Funds dispersed in two installments: 50% upfront, 50% upon completion

Rosa Romano asked about eligibility criteria for established vs. new businesses. Director Williams confirmed priority for businesses operating more than 3 years.

**Vote:** Approved 5-0
