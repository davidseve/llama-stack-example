Dear Diary,

I can't believe they're going to close Bridge 7 for like SIX MONTHS. Nonna is freaking out about the bakery. She kept saying "questi ponti vengono e vanno" (these bridges come and go) but I could tell she's really worried. The bakery has been there since 1963 - same year as the bridge! - and she's scared we'll lose customers who can't get to Historic Downtown easily.

Mr. Ahmed from Al-Rashid Imports came by today and they talked for like an hour about the business relief fund. He's organizing all the downtown merchants to apply together. He's really nice - always speaks to me in Arabic first as a joke ("أهلاً وسهلاً" - welcome!) even though he knows I only speak English and a little Italian.

School was okay. Still struggling in Pre-Calc but Lily Chen said she'd help me after Drama practice tomorrow. She's literally a math genius - like her dad, I guess. Mr. Chen is my Physics teacher AND a city councilman, so he was the one presenting the bridge stuff at the council meeting. Lily says he's been super stressed about it.

Drama rehearsal was AMAZING though. Ms. Patterson gave me the lead in the winter production! Carmen Vasquez is my co-star and she's so talented. Her mom is the hospital director - Dr. Vasquez. Carmen told me her mom is worried about ambulances taking longer to get to the hospital during the bridge closure. That's scary to think about.

Got to go - Nonna needs help with tomorrow's cannoli order.

Dear Diary,

Crazy day. Emmanuel Okafor - he's in Diego's grade, I think - got hurt at basketball practice and had to go to the emergency room. I heard about it because Diego Vasquez (Carmen's little brother) was telling everyone at the bakery after school. He's on the same team as Emmanuel.

The weird part is that Emmanuel's dad is Dr. Okafor, and he works at the SAME HOSPITAL, in the same emergency room where Emmanuel went! Can you imagine your dad being your doctor? That would be so embarrassing. But also kind of cool, I guess. Emmanuel's mom is the engineer lady - Mrs. Okafor - who did the inspection that found all the problems with Bridge 7 in the first place. So basically their family is like at the center of this whole bridge situation.

Carmen said Emmanuel just sprained his ankle and he'll be fine, but he's on crutches for a couple weeks. Diego was joking that at least Emmanuel's house is in New Millbrook on the same side of the bridge as the school, so he won't have trouble getting there during construction.

Speaking of which, Nonna met with some city person today about the business relief fund. She was filling out paperwork all afternoon. She's been running the bakery for longer than anyone - I think she qualifies for everything. Mr. Ahmed helped her with the application. He's so organized. His daughter Fatima is a senior at Lincoln and she's really nice too.

On a happier note - Drama practice was great. Carmen and I are really getting into our characters. She's helping me with my Spanish pronunciation for one of the scenes (the play has some Spanish dialogue). Her Spanish is perfect obviously - she speaks it at home with her mom. Dr. Vasquez is from Colombia originally.

Lily stopped by after school to help me with the Pre-Calc homework. She's the best tutor ever - she explains things so clearly. Her dad came to pick her up and he stopped in the bakery. Nonna gave him some biscotti and he tried to speak Italian to her (I think he said "grazie" like five times). It was cute. He also bought a bunch of pastries and said something in what I think was Mandarin to Lily. I wish I was better at languages. I can barely handle the Italian Nonna teaches me, let alone Spanish or anything else.

Mom's photo is on my nightstand. I wonder what she would think about all this bridge drama. I bet she would have some smart solution. I miss her every day.

Dear Diary,

Church was good today. Father Michael talked about community and supporting each other, which felt really relevant with everything going on. Mr. and Mrs. Martinez were there - she works at the hospital as a nurse manager. I overheard her talking to Dr. Vasquez about emergency response plans for when the bridge closes. They sounded really professional and organized about it. Mrs. Martinez's husband is a firefighter, so I guess her whole family is about saving lives.

After church, Nonna and I did the usual Sunday prep for the week. While we were baking, she told me more stories about when she first came to America from Naples. She opened Romano's Bakery the same year she arrived - 1963. Actually, I was wrong before - she came in 1963 and opened the bakery that same year. She was only 21 years old! I can't imagine doing something that brave.

She talked about my dad (her son) for a while. She doesn't do that often because it makes her sad. He loved the bakery. Sometimes I feel like I need to keep it going for him, you know? Even though I'm only in 11th grade and don't know what I want to do with my life yet.

Carmen texted me about getting together to rehearse lines tomorrow after school. She's also dealing with family stuff - she mentioned her mom has been working crazy hours because of hospital stuff AND the bridge planning. Plus her dad (Mr. Vasquez - he's an architect) has some big project due. At least she has her little brother Diego to hang out with. Sometimes being an only child with just Nonna feels lonely.

On a lighter note - Mr. Ahmed's son Omar came by the bakery today with his little sister Nadia. They're so cute. Omar is in 10th grade I think, and Nadia is in middle school. They were buying bread and some baklava. Mr. Ahmed makes the BEST baklava, but Nonna's cannoli are better (obviously, I'm not biased at all lol).

This bridge situation has made me realize how connected everyone in Millbrook is. Like, Emmanuel's mom inspects the bridge, his dad works at the hospital that's affected by the closure, Carmen's mom runs that hospital, Carmen's dad designs buildings, Lily's dad is on the city council dealing with it, Mrs. Martinez manages the ER that has to deal with longer ambulance times... it's all connected.

I wonder if I'll find something I'm passionate about like all these people. Right now I just like Drama and helping Nonna at the bakery. Is that enough?

Anyway, school tomorrow. Need to finish my Physics homework (ugh, Mr. Chen assigns so much) and study for the Spanish quiz.

Dear Diary,

BIG NEWS - they're starting the bridge construction next week! There was a huge community meeting at the Historic Downtown Community Center tonight. Literally everyone was there. Mayor Thompson, the whole city council, the engineer lady (Mrs. Okafor), tons of downtown business owners, hospital people, school people, EVERYONE.

Nonna made me come with her. At first I was annoyed because I wanted to hang out with Carmen, but actually it was pretty interesting. Mrs. Okafor gave this whole presentation with slides and everything about the bridge structure and what they're going to do. She's really smart - she had all these technical diagrams but explained it so regular people could understand.

Mr. Chen asked a lot of questions about the timeline. Mrs. Okafor said 6-8 months, but possibly longer if they find more problems once they start working. That made some people upset. Mr. Ahmed stood up and talked about how hard this will be for downtown businesses. He was really respectful but firm. Nonna nodded along with everything he said.

Dr. Vasquez talked about the hospital's plan. She brought Mrs. Martinez with her and they explained how they've arranged for extra ambulances and changed some procedures. Dr. Vasquez said something like "we cannot compromise patient safety" and everyone clapped. She's kind of intimidating but in a good way. I can see where Carmen gets her confidence.

There was interpretation in Spanish, Mandarin, and Arabic which was cool. Shows how diverse Millbrook is. The Spanish interpreter was really good - I could understand her even better than when people speak Spanish normally.

Some guy asked about property values and whether the bridge construction would hurt home prices. Honestly seemed like a jerk question when people are worried about their businesses and hospital patients. But the City Manager guy answered it politely anyway.

At the end they had coffee and cookies (NOT as good as Nonna's, just saying). I ran into Lily and her parents. Mrs. Chen works in tech I think - she was asking really detailed questions about the traffic routing algorithms. Lily just rolled her eyes and said "Mom's being a software engineer about everything again."

I also saw Emmanuel on his crutches with his mom and dad and little sister Chioma. He seemed embarrassed about the crutches but was joking around with some other kids. His parents are both really tall. Dr. Okafor (Emmanuel's dad) was talking to Dr. Vasquez and Mrs. Martinez - I guess they all work together.

On the way home, Nonna was quiet. Then she said in Italian, "Isabella, this community takes care of its own. We will be okay." I hope she's right. The bakery means everything to her. It means everything to me too.

Starting to feel like maybe I do know what I'm passionate about - this neighborhood, these people, this place. Maybe that's enough.
